title: '" I can show what I really like." Eliciting Preferences via Quadratic Voting'
abstract: "Surveys are a common instrument to gauge self-reported opinions from
  the crowd for scholars in the CSCW community, the social sciences, and many
  other research areas. Researchers often use surveys to prioritize a subset of
  given options when there are resource constraints. Over the past century,
  researchers have developed a wide range of surveying techniques, including one
  of the most popular instruments, the Likert ordinal scale, to elicit
  individual preferences. However, the challenge to elicit accurate and rich
  self-reported responses with surveys in a resource-constrained context still
  persists today. In this study, we examine Quadratic Voting (QV), a voting
  mechanism powered by the affordances of a modern computer and straddles
  ratings and rankings approaches, as an alternative online survey technique. We
  argue that QV could elicit more accurate self-reported responses compared to
  the Likert scale when the goal is to understand relative preferences under
  resource constraints. We conducted two randomized controlled experiments on
  Amazon Mechanical Turk, one in the context of public opinion polling and the
  other in a human-computer interaction user study. Based on our Bayesian
  analysis results, a QV survey with a sufficient amount of voice credits,
  aligned significantly closer to participants' incentive-compatible behaviors
  than a Likert scale survey, with a medium to high effect size. In addition, we
  extended QV's application scenario from typical public policy and education
  research to a problem setting familiar to the CSCW community: a prototypical
  HCI user study. Our experiment results, QV survey design, and QV interface
  serve as a stepping stone for CSCW researchers to further explore this
  surveying methodology in their studies and encourage decision-makers from
  other communities to consider QV as a promising alternative."
