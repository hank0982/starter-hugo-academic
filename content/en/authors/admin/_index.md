> Help developers to collaborate, code, and have fun.

Yi-Hung Chou is first-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine, where he will be advised by [Prof. James A. Jones](https://jamesajones.com/). He received B.Sc Computer Science with [ELITE stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite) from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), and he is expected to earn his Master of Science in Software Engineering at UC Irvine this summer. Throughout his academic journey, he has been fortunate to have the guidance and mentorship of exceptional professors, including [Prof. David Redmiles](https://redmiles.ics.uci.edu/), [Prof. Rafael Prikladnicki](https://www.inf.pucrs.br/rafael/), [Prof. Tobias Schimmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiashildenbrand/), and [Prof. Steven Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/). His mind is delightfully contaminated by [Ti-Chung Cheng](https://tichung.com/about/) and [Dr. Grace Yen](https://gracetfg2.github.io/), who lured Yi-Hung away from his lucrative and routine software engineer life into the wild, unpredictable world of academia.

For anyone who is interested in working with me as undergraduate researcher, please check [this post](https://yihungchou.com/en/post/undergraduate-research-opportunity/) about research opportunity. Send me an email about who you are, what is your major, what motivates you to work with me. I am open to students from any major as long as you are willing to learn either programming, specifically, ReactJS and LangChain, or to learn how to conduct user study. Looking forward to your emails!
