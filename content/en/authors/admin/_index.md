> Help developers to collaborate, code, and have fun.

Yi-Hung Chou is a second-year Ph.D. student at UC Irvine, where he is fortunate to be advised by [Prof. James A. Jones](https://jamesajones.com/). He received his B.Sc. in Computer Science with the [ELITE stream](https://www.erg.cuhk.edu.hk/erg/Elite) from [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) and earned his Master of Science in Software Engineering at UC Irvine this summer. Throughout his academic journey, he has benefited from the guidance and mentorship of outstanding professors, including [Prof. April Wang](https://aprilwang.me/), [Prof. Grace Yen](https://gracetfg2.github.io/), [Prof. David Redmiles](https://redmiles.ics.uci.edu/), [Prof. Rafael Prikladnicki](https://www.inf.pucrs.br/rafael/), [Prof. Tobias Schimmer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tobiashildenbrand/), and [Prof. Steven Dow](https://spdow.ucsd.edu/). His intellectual curiosity has been delightfully shaped by [Ti-Chung Cheng](https://tichung.com/about/), who inspired him to leave a stable, lucrative career in software engineering for the dynamic and unpredictable world of academia.

For anyone who is interested in working with me as undergraduate researcher, please check [this post](https://yihungchou.com/en/post/undergraduate-research-opportunity/) about research opportunity. Send me an email about who you are, what is your major, what motivates you to work with me. I am open to students from any major as long as you are willing to learn either programming, specifically, ReactJS and LangChain, or to learn how to conduct user study. Looking forward to your emails!
