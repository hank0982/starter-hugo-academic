	abstract = {Capturing naturalistic human experience is a fundamental challenge for researchers in psychology and related fields. Fortunately, as demonstrated by the broad scope of this handbook, there is an increasing number of methodologies for studying the full range of experiences, behavior, and physiology as people go about their daily lives. Our goal in this chapter is to provide a starting point for researchers interesting in using these methods. Our aim is to provide practical guidance and basic considerations in how to design and conduct a study of individuals over time in their naturalistic environments. We explain how basic design considerations depend on a number of factorsâ€”the type of research question, the characteristics of the sample of interest, the nature of the phenomena under investigation, and the resources available to conduct the research. We address each consideration in turn and integrate our practical discussions with examples that draw on different types of research questions. In this way, our chapter lays a foundation for the more advanced chapters that follow in this section of the Handbook. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},
