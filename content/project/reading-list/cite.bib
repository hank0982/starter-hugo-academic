	abstract = {Methods for studying user behavior in HCI can be informally divided into two approaches: experimental psychology in the laboratory and observations in the workplace. The first approach has been faulted for providing results that have little effect on system usability, while the second can often be accused of yielding primarily anecdotal data that do not support general conclusions. This paper describes two similar approaches in another field, the study of animal behavior, and shows how they produce complementary results. To support similar complementary interactions between research approaches in the HCI field, the paper describes the diary study technique, a tool for research in the workplace that achieves a relatively high standard of objectivity. A diary study is reported that focuses on exploratory learning.},

	abstract = {Capturing naturalistic human experience is a fundamental challenge for researchers in psychology and related fields. Fortunately, as demonstrated by the broad scope of this handbook, there is an increasing number of methodologies for studying the full range of experiences, behavior, and physiology as people go about their daily lives. Our goal in this chapter is to provide a starting point for researchers interesting in using these methods. Our aim is to provide practical guidance and basic considerations in how to design and conduct a study of individuals over time in their naturalistic environments. We explain how basic design considerations depend on a number of factors—the type of research question, the characteristics of the sample of interest, the nature of the phenomena under investigation, and the resources available to conduct the research. We address each consideration in turn and integrate our practical discussions with examples that draw on different types of research questions. In this way, our chapter lays a foundation for the more advanced chapters that follow in this section of the Handbook. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Powered by recent advances in code-generating models, AI assistants like Github Copilot promise to change the face of programming forever. But what is this new face of programming? We present the first grounded theory analysis of how programmers interact with Copilot, based on observing 20 participants—with a range of prior experience using the assistant—as they solve diverse programming tasks across four languages. Our main finding is that interactions with programming assistants are bimodal: in acceleration mode, the programmer knows what to do next and uses Copilot to get there faster; in exploration mode, the programmer is unsure how to proceed and uses Copilot to explore their options. Based on our theory, we provide recommendations for improving the usability of future AI programming assistants.},
